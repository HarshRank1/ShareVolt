Project Overview
ShareVolt is solving a major problem for both the government and the public. It addresses the high cost of building electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure and provides an "anywhere, anytime" charging service for users.

ShareVolt is a platform that gives people access to find EV chargers during their journey or at their destination. It also benefits hosts by allowing them to earn income from the chargers they have installed at their homes or offices.

On the technical side, each user is required to have an account to make a booking at a charger. Similarly, a host must create an account to list their charger on the platform.

As a company, ShareVolt earns revenue by charging a certain percentage of the total bill from the user and also charges hosts to list their chargers on the platform.

Users can pay ShareVolt through any payment gateway, debit card, or credit card. Hosts receive their earnings within the application itself.

Future Features
In the future, ShareVolt cannot rely on a software-based model alone. Currently, users pay at the time of booking.

However, as we implement and launch at an industry level, we will need to incorporate hardware-based conditions. This will allow users to pay after their charging session is complete.

Setup Instructions
This project can run on an IIS Server and uses SQL Server Management Studio for database management.

Team Members and Individual Contributions
This project was completed by me alone, so all features were implemented by me.
